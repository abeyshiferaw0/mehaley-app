    "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.",
    "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.",
    "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.",
    "But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this? ",
    "God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.",
    "Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. His bones [are as] strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.",
    "The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.",
    "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou [art] God.",
    "Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.",
    "Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.",

    "I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.",
    "I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.",
    "For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.",
    "For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.",

    "All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.",
    "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.",
    "For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected [the same] in hope, Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.",
